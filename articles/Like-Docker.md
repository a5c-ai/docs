Composable AI Agents: Building Intelligence Like Docker Layers
How community‑driven inheritance turns isolated prompts into an ecosystem.
Tired of one‑off prompts disappearing in random chats? It's time for reusable, version‑controlled - and community‑powered - intelligence.
Imagine keeping your best AI tricks in Git the same way you keep code and swapping them as easily as Docker images on Docker Hub. a5c packages prompts as agents - self‑contained, shareable blocks that inherit, extend, and collaborate just like software libraries. When a community rallies around those blocks, magic happens.
Why This Beats Copy‑Paste Culture
Pros
Reusable: define once, use everywhere.
Auditable: every tweak lives in Git history.
Collaborative: teammates - and strangers on the internet - branch, review, and improve prompts together.
Composable: build specialized agents from proven bases - no starting from scratch.
Community‑tested: fixes and best practices flow in from hundreds of contributors, not just your team.

Cons of the Old Way
Fragile docs, screenshots, and Slack threads.
Zero version control - no idea who changed what, when.
Knowledge silos; new hires start from scratch.
Hard to scale; every project reinvents the wheel.

Composable agents fix all of that - and add the network effect that turned Docker from a neat CLI into a global standard.
Community: The Engine Behind the Layers
Docker didn't win on tech alone; it won because the world could freely share, fork, and remix containers. a5c follows the same playbook:
Open Registry: Publish your agents to the a5c registry - think Docker Hub for intelligence.
Fork & PR Culture: Anyone can propose an improvement. A merged PR updates the base agent for everyone inheriting from it.
Social Proof: Stars, issues, and discussions surface the most trusted prompts.
Shared Responsibility: Security patches, model‑upgrade tweaks, and compliance fixes reach thousands of inheritors overnight.

When inheritance meets a vibrant community, each new agent stands on the collective shoulders of yesterday's work.
Why Composability Matters
Teams today keep prompts in Notion docs, Slack threads, or random gists. Nothing is shared, tracked, or improved in a structured way.
Agents in a5c flip that:
Prompts and metadata live in Markdown + YAML files inside Git.
Anyone can branch, tweak, and PR improvements.
The community's best ideas become reusable building blocks for everyone.

Prompt engineering turns from tribal craft into open‑source engineering.
Inheritance 101 (Now with Crowd Wisdom)
name: security-reviewer
from: base-reviewer           # inherit!
category: security
---
{{base-prompt}}
Additionally, look for OWASP Top‑10 issues and insecure dependencies.
How it works:
Base agent (base-reviewer) defines generic review logic.
Child agent pulls that logic with {{base-prompt}} and appends its own focus.
All other YAML fields - triggers, tools, model settings - can be inherited, overridden, or merged.
Community chain‑reacts: one improvement to base-reviewer flows instantly to every descendant across public repos.

Result: your agent gets smarter while you sleep.
Stackable Intelligence in Action
base-reviewer
   ├── security-reviewer
   │     └── advanced-security-reviewer
   └── performance-reviewer
Need accessibility checks? from: base-reviewer → add WCAG rules. Done.
Because it's Git, you - or someone across the globe - can open a PR to update base-reviewer and instantly upgrade all derived agents. This is the same "update your base image" workflow that powers modern DevOps, now applied to prompts.
Agents That Write Agents (And Share Them)
Inheritance is cool - generation is cooler.
A schema‑generator agent can inspect your codebase and auto‑create a specialized db‑migration agent.
A starter‑kit agent can read an issue like "Add Stripe billing" and spawn a billing‑bot agent configured with Stripe docs + keys.

Meta‑agents write YAML + Markdown, commit them, and open a PR against the same community registry. Humans just review and merge. Your agent ecosystem literally grows itself, and the crowd ensures quality.
Git Keeps It Honest
Every agent definition is:
Versioned: diffable changes, blame history.
Reviewable: PR discussions on prompt tweaks.
Releasable: tag versions, roll back if needed.

No hidden prompt magic - just transparent, testable artifacts living beside your code and visible to the community.
Quick Start Checklist
Pick a base: the a5c registry has ready‑made agents.
Derive: create my-team-reviewer.agent.md with from: base-reviewer.
Tweak: add team style guide, set mentions: ["@review-me"].
Push & PR: let teammates (and external contributors) review the new agent like any code change.
Watch It Run: PRs now get custom feedback - no extra tooling required.

The Future: Lego Blocks of Intelligence - Powered by People
Composable agents mean you're never starting from zero. You're snapping together high‑level behaviors, remixing proven prompts, and letting your AI workforce evolve in‑repo - with the entire internet pitching in.
Write less prompt. Ship more product. Grow smarter together.
That's the power of building intelligence like Docker layers - and it's all yours with a5c.
