# a5c: Git-Native AI Agent Orchestration Platform - Comprehensive Technical Overview

*Build Unicorn-Scale Software Solo: Your Repository Becomes Your Team*

## Executive Summary

a5c is a revolutionary open-source platform that transforms Git repositories into intelligent, autonomous development environments through the orchestration of AI agent squads. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that require constant human input, a5c agents work proactively within your repository infrastructure, continuously improving code quality, fixing builds, implementing features, and maintaining documentation while developers focus on higher-level architecture and business logic.

The platform fundamentally changes the developer experience by making your repository self-improving and turning Git into the single source of truth for both code and AI instructions. Your repo becomes your team - agents code, deploy, spot improvements, and collaborate autonomously.

## What is a5c?

a5c (Agentic) brings autonomous AI agent squads to your repository, turning it into a self-improving codebase that builds software while you focus on bigger things. The platform operates on four core pillars:

### üöÄ From Chat to Commit
Describe what you need, get fully deployed software. Push a README that says "I need a dashboard with user auth," close your laptop, and let the agents work while you sleep. The platform handles the entire development lifecycle from conception to deployment.

### üìù Git-Native Storage
Everything lives in Git: conversations, agent actions, and code history in one place. Your prompts are versioned, shareable, and survive developer turnover. Unlike chat-based tools where valuable prompts get lost, a5c makes your team's AI knowledge a permanent asset that evolves with your codebase.

### ü§ñ Proactive Agents
Autonomously fix bugs, update dependencies, improve quality, and implement new features. Agents work 24/7 in your CI/CD pipeline, monitoring for issues and opportunities for improvement. They don't wait for prompts - they actively watch your repository and take action when needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Model Flexibility
Works with any LLM: Claude, GPT, Gemini - switch with one line of code. The platform is model-agnostic, allowing you to choose the best AI provider for your needs without vendor lock-in. Change providers by updating a single configuration file.

## Technical Architecture

### Git-Native Orchestration

Your agents live as files in your repository, triggered by Git events like commits, pull requests, and issues. They have full context of your codebase history, can read CI results, and commit changes back. This means your AI agents are part of your development workflow, not external tools.

Key technical features:
- **Event-driven architecture**: Agents respond to Git webhooks and repository events
- **Full system access**: Read logs, diagnose failures, commit fixes
- **Repository memory**: Agents remember decisions, patterns, and evolution
- **Stateful intelligence**: Context persists across development sessions

### Agent Registry and Inheritance System

a5c implements a Docker-like layered architecture for AI agents:

```yaml
---
from: a5c://agents/development/base-reviewer
name: frontend-reviewer
model: a5c://models/anthropic/claude/4/sonnet
agent_type: a5c://agent_types/claude-code-cli
traits:
    - a5c://traits/html-javascript-css-expert  
    - git+https://github.com/acme/my-registry/blob/main/traits/acme-brand-aware.md
tools:
    - playwright    
triggers:
    mentions:
       - @frontend-review
    events:
       - pull_request
---

```

#### Composable Intelligence
- **Layered inheritance**: Agents inherit from each other in layers, building specialized tools from proven foundations
- **Community registry**: Share agents in a public registry, fork, improve, and contribute back
- **Collective evolution**: One improvement flows to all inheritors, making agents smarter over time

### Model-Agnostic Infrastructure

The platform supports multiple AI providers through a unified interface:
- **OpenAI GPT models**: Works out of the box, no configuration needed
- **Anthropic Claude**: Better reasoning capabilities, requires minimal config changes
- **Google Gemini**: Full integration support
- **Custom models**: Extensible architecture for new providers

Configuration switching example:
```yaml
cli_command: "claude --model=claude-4 --max-tokens=8192"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why store prompts in Git?
Git becomes your single source of truth for both code and AI instructions. Your prompts are versioned, shareable, and survive developer turnover. Unlike chat-based tools where valuable prompts get lost, a5c makes your team's AI knowledge a permanent asset that evolves with your codebase.

### How is this different from Cursor?
Cursor is an IDE assistant that helps you write code in the editor. a5c orchestrates entire development workflows - from architecture decisions to CI/CD fixes to deployment. While Cursor operates at the file level, a5c sees your entire repository history, test results, and deployment status to make holistic decisions.

### What does "Git-native orchestration" mean?
Your agents live as files in your repository, triggered by Git events like commits, PRs, and issues. They have full context of your codebase history, can read CI results, and commit changes back. This means your AI agents are part of your development workflow, not external tools.

### Can I use it in a private repo?
Absolutely. a5c is open-source and runs entirely within your infrastructure. Your code, prompts, and AI interactions never leave your environment. You control the models, the data, and the execution - perfect for enterprise environments with strict security requirements.

### Is the IP generated by these agents mine?
Yes, completely. All code, documentation, and artifacts generated by a5c agents belong to you. Since a5c runs in your environment using your chosen models, there's no third-party claim on your intellectual property. Your agents, your code, your IP.

## The Future of Development

a5c represents a fundamental shift in how software is built. Instead of developers being the bottleneck in the development process, they become orchestrators of intelligent systems that handle routine tasks, enabling focus on architecture, business logic, and creative problem-solving.

The platform turns the concept of "building software" into "building software that builds software" - creating a compound effect where your development capabilities grow over time through the collective intelligence of your agent ecosystem.

**Building Software Never Ends** - It's about constant improvements and iterations. With a5c, you're not looking at an end-to-end process ‚Äî you're looking at a constantly, proactively improving system that works 24/7 to make your codebase better.
