Backbone AI Agents: letting your repository think for itself
AI agents that live in your repo, keep the whole codebase in their head, and act the moment you commit - so every team member works with the same built‑in brain.

---

1 ▸ Where the agents live matters
Most "AI coding tools" hover in editors or SaaS dashboards. Backbone agents are different: they install inside the repository infrastructure - Git hooks, CI jobs, container images.
 Result: the agent wakes up with the exact files, branches, and history you do. No API calls to fetch context, no stale snapshots, no privacy gaps.

---

2 ▸ Full‑context reasoning beats autocomplete
Because the repo is their workspace, Backbone agents can:
Typical code assistant Backbone AI agent Sees the open file Indexes the entire branch and commit graph Ignores build scripts & tests Parses Dockerfiles, CI configs, docs - everything Forgets after the session Carries architectural memory across weeks
Context depth means the agent can refactor safely, respect conventions, and spot knock‑on effects a chat window never sees.

---

3 ▸ Actions, not suggestions
Backbone agents don't just propose code; they act:
Commit fixes and open pull requests
Run unit & integration tests
Update docs, configs, and release notes
Post status back to Slack or Jira

Think of them as automated teammates with push access - governed by the same branch‑protection rules you already enforce.

---

4 ▸ Commit‑driven automation (GitOps for behaviour)
Every delta you push is both history and trigger:
Developer commits feature.user-profiles.yaml
Backbone dev agent detects the diff → scaffolds models, CRUD routes, migration scripts
Backbone test agent expands the test suite → runs CI
Backbone docs agent updates API docs → pushes to docs branch

One pipeline, zero context‑switches. Your source of truth drives real work.

---

5 ▸ Consistent intelligence for the whole team
Because agents live in the repo:
Same behaviour everywhere - laptop, CI, or prod container all invoke the identical code‑aware AI.
Instant onboarding - new hires clone the repo and inherit the built‑in expertise.
Auditability - every agent action is a signed commit; rollback is one git revert away.

---

6 ▸ Extensibility layer - zero lock‑in
A5C's open spec lets you plug in any language model or agent framework. Swap GPT‑4o for Claude, fine‑tune your own model, or mix multiple providers - the agents keep working without rewrites and your team stays free of vendor lock‑in.

---

7 ▸ How to adopt Backbone agents
Define roles (/agents/dev.yaml, /agents/qa.yaml)
Install the hook / action (a5c init)
Push - agents pick up the diff, execute, commit results.

No new dashboards, no external databases - just Git, CI, and the language runtimes you already ship.

---

8 ▸ Why this changes the game
Autocomplete tools speed up typing.
 Backbone AI agents speed up software evolution: they remember architecture, enforce consistency, act on every change, and remain as portable as the code itself. Your repository stops being a passive store of files and becomes the active backbone of team intelligence.

The future isn't coding with an assistant - it's coding in a repository that assists you. Backbone AI agents make that future a Git clone away.
