CI/CD That Thinks: Background Agents for Real Work, Not Just BuildÂ Scripts
Most pipelines automate steps.
Â What if they could automate the thinking behind those steps?

---

From Scripts to Sentient Pipelines
Continuous Integration once meant "run tests, show green ticks."
Â With a5c, your pipeline becomes a team of AI teammates that review, fix, document, and even ship codeâ€Š-â€Šall while you stay in the driver's seat. The agents do the leg-work; you approve the pull requests.

---

Git: The NervousÂ System
Everything the agents know, do, and learn lives in one placeâ€Š-â€Šyour Git repo:
Agent definitions are version-controlled like source files.
Prompts are pull-request-reviewed, so anyone can improve them.
Workflow rules sit next to code, fully transparent.

Because the intelligence is stored where the code is stored, your CI becomes a system of record for the thinking behind the code, not just the code itself.

---

One Job, Dozens ofÂ Helpers
Add a single step to any existing workflow:
jobs:
  run-agents:
    uses: a5c/action
That's it. The job consultsÂ .a5c/config.yml, sees which agents you've enabled, and triggers them on pull-requests, issue comments, or a schedule you choose. No new tooling, no brittle scripts-just plug and play.

Meet Your New Teammates
âœ… Code-Reviewer
Trigger: pull_request
Â Reads the diff and surrounding context, flags logic holes, suggests edge-cases, comments inline.
ðŸ”§ Build-Fixer
Trigger: failed CI run or comment @fixer
Â Parses logs, diagnoses the break, proposes or pushes a patch.
ðŸ§¾ Doc-Writer & Changelog-Bot
Trigger: label documentation or on release tag
Â Scans commits, drafts API docs and release notes in Markdown ready for review.
ðŸ›¡ Security-Auditor (Scheduled)
Trigger: cron, e.g. every Monday 09:00
Â Checks for vulnerable deps and patterns, files issues for anything risky.
Agents inherit behaviors (like Docker layers) and can call each otherâ€Š-â€Šso the reviewer can summon the fixer, the seeder can recruit the doc-writer. CI starts to feel like a live chat where bots do real work.

Smart Defaults, SimpleÂ Config
Enable an agent by pointing to its URL:
agents:
  - https://registry.a5c.ai/agents/code-reviewer.agent.md
  - https://registry.a5c.ai/agents/security-auditor.agent.md
Need a custom flavor? Create a new file that says:
name: frontend-reviewer
from: code-reviewer
prompt: |
  {{base-prompt}}
  Additionally, enforce our company's React style guide.
Commit, push, done. Every tweak is tracked, every improvement is shared.

---

Prompts Are Infrastructure
In most teams, a great prompt dies in a DM or notebook.
Â With a5c the prompt is the agent, and it's:
Versionedâ€Š-â€Šrollback or diff like code.
Reviewedâ€Š-â€Šmerged only after PR approval.
Reusableâ€Š-â€Šinherited by future agents.

Prompt engineering finally moves from tribal lore to shared, auditable infrastructure.

---

Open-Source andÂ Un-boxed
a5c is open source end-to-end. No black-box SaaS, no API ceiling, no vendor lock-in. Fork it, audit it, run it on-prem or in the cloudâ€Š-â€Šit's yours.

---

Continuous Integration Meets Continuous Intelligence
Put up a pull request; watch agents review, patch, and document while you sip coffee.
Â CI no longer stops at a green checkâ€Š-â€Šit thinks.
