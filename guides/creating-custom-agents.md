# Creating Custom Agents

This guide walks you through the process of creating custom agents for your A5C projects. Custom agents allow you to address specific needs and workflows that aren't covered by the standard agent library.

## When to Create Custom Agents

Consider creating custom agents when:

1. **Specialized Workflows**: You have unique workflows not covered by standard agents
2. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: You need agents with expertise in your domain
3. **Custom Integrations**: You want to integrate with specialized tools or services
4. **Team Practices**: You want to enforce team-specific practices and standards
5. **Advanced Automation**: You need complex automation beyond basic agents

## Prerequisites

Before creating custom agents, ensure you have:

1. A GitHub repository with A5C installed
2. Basic understanding of A5C concepts and architecture
3. Knowledge of the workflows you want to automate
4. Access to modify repository files

## Custom Agent Structure

A5C agents consist of two main parts:

1. **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata that defines agent properties and configuration
2. **Instructions**: Markdown content that guides the agent's behavior

### Basic Agent Template

Here's a template for a custom agent:

```markdown
---
name: custom-agent
version: 1.0.0
category: development
description: Custom agent for specialized tasks
model: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
triggers:
  events:
    - push
  mentions:
    - "@custom-agent"
  file_patterns:
    - "src/custom/**/*.js"
---

# Custom Agent
