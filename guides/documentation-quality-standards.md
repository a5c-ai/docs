# Documentation Quality Standards

This guide provides comprehensive quality standards for A5C documentation. It serves as a reference for validator agents, content writers, and anyone reviewing documentation quality.

## Quality Dimensions

A5C documentation is evaluated across six key quality dimensions:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Correctness of technical information
2. **Completeness**: Coverage of necessary information
3. **Clarity**: Clear communication and understandability
4. **Consistency**: Uniform style, terminology, and structure
5. **Usability**: Ease of navigation and practical application
6. **Maintainability**: Ease of updating and managing over time

## Quality Evaluation Process

### Initial Self-Assessment

Authors should use these checklists for initial self-assessment:

1. Review the document against all applicable checklists
2. Mark items as complete, partially complete, or incomplete
3. Address all incomplete items before submission
4. Note any exceptions or special considerations

### Validator Agent Review

The validator-agent performs systematic reviews:

1. Evaluate the document against all applicable checklists
2. Provide specific feedback on incomplete items
3. Suggest concrete improvements
4. Note overall quality assessment

Example validator-agent invocation:

```markdown
@validator-agent

Please review [DOCUMENT PATH] using our Documentation Quality Standards.

Focus particularly on:
- Technical accuracy of the API reference section
- Completeness of the troubleshooting information
- Clarity of the architecture diagrams
- Consistency with our recently updated terminology

Please provide a detailed assessment with specific recommendations for improvement.
```

### Peer Review Process

Human reviewers should:

1. Use the checklists as a systematic guide
2. Provide specific, actionable feedback
3. Distinguish between critical and minor issues
4. Suggest concrete improvements
5. Acknowledge strengths as well as weaknesses

### Continuous Improvement

Quality standards are regularly reviewed and enhanced:

1. Collect feedback on documentation effectiveness
2. Analyze common quality issues
3. Update standards to address emerging needs
4. Expand examples of best practices
5. Refine evaluation processes

## Quality Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

Measure documentation quality with these metrics:

- **Accuracy rate**: Percentage of technically accurate information
- **Completeness score**: Coverage of required information
- **Link validity**: Percentage of valid, working links
- **Readability scores**: Flesch-Kincaid or similar measures
- **Task completion rate**: User success in following instructions
- **Support ticket reduction**: Decrease in related support questions
- **User satisfaction**: Ratings and feedback scores

### Qualitative Assessment

Supplement metrics with qualitative evaluation:

- **Expert reviews**: Assessment by subject matter experts
- **User feedback**: Comments and suggestions from users
- **Usability testing**: Observation of users interacting with documentation
- **Comparative analysis**: Benchmarking against industry standards
- **Longitudinal assessment**: Changes in quality over time

## Automating Quality Checks

A5C can automate many quality checks:

### Build-Time Validation

```yaml
# Documentation build validation in GitHub Actions
name: Documentation Quality Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '**/*.rst'

jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Check links
        uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1
        
      - name: Check spelling
        uses: rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions@v0
        
      - name: Check style
        uses: errata-ai/vale-action@v1
        
      - name: A5C Validator Agent Review
        uses: a5c-ai/action@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          config_file: ".a5c/config.yml"
          agent: "validator-agent"
          custom_prompt: "Review the documentation changes in this PR using our Documentation Quality Standards."
```

### A5C Validator Integration

Configure your validator-agent for automated quality checks:

```yaml
# In your validator-agent configuration
events: ["pull_request"]
paths: ["**/*.md", "**/*.rst"]
actions:
  - type: "comment"
    body: |
      # Documentation Quality Review
      
      I've reviewed the documentation changes using our quality standards.
