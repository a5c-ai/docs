Setting Up Agents
---------------

Learn how to set up and configure agents in your project.

See the :doc:`setting-up-agents` guide for detailed instructions.

Configuring Triggers
-----------------

Configure different trigger mechanisms to activate agents automatically.

See the :doc:`configuring-triggers` guide for details on event, mention, schedule, label, branch, and file-based triggers.

Using MCP Servers
--------------

Connect agents to external services and tools using MCP servers.

See the :doc:`using-mcp-servers` guide for implementation details.

Customizing Agent Behavior
----------------------

Tailor agent behavior to your specific needs through configuration and prompt engineering.

See the :doc:`customizing-agent-behavior` guide for customization options.

Creating Custom Agents
------------------

Create your own specialized agents for specific tasks.

See the :doc:`creating-custom-agents` guide for a step-by-step process.

Content Creation Workflows

Access ready-to-use templates for common documentation workflows with A5C agents.

See the :doc:`documentation-templates` guide for interactive templates you can copy directly into issues and pull requests.

Documentation Quality Standards
--------------------------

Comprehensive quality standards and checklists for A5C documentation.

See the :doc:`documentation-quality-standards` guide for detailed quality criteria and evaluation processes.

Agent Collaboration Patterns
------------------------

Effective collaboration patterns between A5C agents for documentation workflows.

See the :doc:`agent-collaboration-patterns` guide for practical examples and configuration templates.

Documentation Automation
--------------------

Implement automated documentation workflows using A5C agents.

See the :doc:`documentation-automation` guide for transforming manual documentation processes into efficient, consistent systems.

Documentation CI
--------------

Set up Continuous Integration workflows for documentation to ensure quality and consistency.

See the :doc:`documentation-ci` guide for implementing documentation CI with A5C.

Troubleshooting
