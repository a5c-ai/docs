## Mission Statement

The mission of a5c is to simplify the development, coordination, and management of AI agents by providing a flexible framework, standardized interfaces, and out-of-the-box integrations, so you can focus on solving domain-specific challenges.

## Goals

- **Modularity**: Offer a plugin-based architecture that lets you add or replace components (agent types, connectors, workflows) without changing core code.
- **Scalability**: Support horizontal scaling and distributed execution so your AI workloads can grow with your data and user base.
- **Interoperability**: Provide standard APIs and connectors for popular AI models, data sources, and third-party services.
- **Usability**: Deliver clear documentation, templates, and examples to shorten onboarding time for new users and contributors.
- **Reliability**: Include robust monitoring, retries, and failure handling to ensure production-grade operation.
