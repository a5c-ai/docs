# How-To Guides

Welcome to the **How-To Guides** section. Here you'll find step-by-step instructions for common tasks and workflows using **a5c**, from bootstrapping your repository to automating advanced AI agent pipelines.

## Key Topics

- **Initialize a5c in your repository**: Get started with a minimal configuration and run your first agent.
- **Add and configure custom AI agents**: Define your own agents and adjust settings in `.a5c/config.yml`.
- **Implement label-based triggers**: Automate workflows based on issue or pull request labels.
- **Chain agents into pipelines**: Combine multiple agents to perform multi-step automation.
- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Embed a5c workflows into GitHub Actions or other pipelines.
- **Debug and troubleshoot agents**: Collect logs, handle failures, and recover from errors.

| **Bootstrap a5c**                | Initialize and run your first AI agent. See [Start Here](start_here.md).               |
| **Create a custom AI agent**     | Add a new agent definition under `.a5c/agents/` and test it locally. See [User Guide](guide.md). |
| **Configure label-based automation** | Use issue/PR labels to trigger agents automatically. Includes GitHub Actions examples. |
| **Build an agent pipeline**      | Chain multiple agents to implement complex workflows. See [Tutorials](tutorials.md).    |
| **CI/CD integration**            | Integrate a5c into your CI/CD pipelines. See [CI/CD That Thinks](articles/CI-CD-That-Thinks.md). |
| **Troubleshoot and recover**     | Best practices for debugging agents and handling errors.                                |
| **Operational tips**             | Best practices for scaffolding PRs, E2E readiness, and choosing AWS ECS over Kubernetes. |

## Operational Tips for Scaffolding PRs and E2E Readiness

When working with a5c agents in your repository, follow these operational best practices to streamline development and maximize automation benefits:

### Approve scaffolded PRs quickly
For scaffolding PRs generated by initial agents, review and merge promptly to maintain agent momentum and enable subsequent workflows.

### Enable proactive agent runs after E2E tests
Once your end-to-end (E2E) test suite is stable and integrated, a5c agents can proactively suggest or execute actions. Ensure your E2E tests are reliable to benefit from anticipatory automation.

### Use AWS ECS over Kubernetes for simplicity
To avoid complex Kubernetes setups, deploy your agents and workloads on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). ECS offers simpler configuration and management for containerized AI agents without sacrificing scalability.

## Best Practices

- **Keep guides focused**: Cover one task per tutorial for clarity.
- **Include real examples**: Show code snippets and expected outputs.
- **Link to reference material**: Point to the [Reference](reference.md) section for deeper details.
- **Highlight integration points**: Demonstrate how tutorials fit with articles and guides.
