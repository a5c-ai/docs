# How-To Guides

Welcome to the **How-To Guides** section. Here you'll find step-by-step instructions for common tasks and workflows using **a5c**, from bootstrapping your repository to automating advanced AI agent pipelines.

## Key Topics

- **Initialize a5c in your repository**: Get started with a minimal configuration and run your first agent.
- **Add and configure custom AI agents**: Define your own agents and adjust settings in `.a5c/config.yml`.
- **Implement label-based triggers**: Automate workflows based on issue or pull request labels.
- **Chain agents into pipelines**: Combine multiple agents to perform multi-step automation.
- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Embed a5c workflows into GitHub Actions or other pipelines.
- **Debug and troubleshoot agents**: Collect logs, handle failures, and recover from errors.

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bootstrap a5c**                | Initialize and run your first AI agent. See [Start Here](start_here.md).               |
| **Create a custom AI agent**     | Add a new agent definition under `.a5c/agents/` and test it locally. See [User Guide](guide.md). |
| **Configure label-based automation** | Use issue/PR labels to trigger agents automatically. Includes GitHub Actions examples. |
| **Build an agent pipeline**      | Chain multiple agents to implement complex workflows. See [Tutorials](tutorials.md).    |
| **CI/CD integration**            | Integrate a5c into your CI/CD pipelines. See [CI/CD That Thinks](articles/CI-CD-That-Thinks.md). |
| **Troubleshoot and recover**     | Best practices for debugging agents and handling errors.                                |

## Best Practices

- **Keep guides focused**: Cover one task per tutorial for clarity.
- **Include real examples**: Show code snippets and expected outputs.
- **Link to reference material**: Point to the [Reference](reference.md) section for deeper details.
- **Highlight integration points**: Demonstrate how tutorials fit with articles and guides.
