# Specs

The a5c Specs section captures all project specifications, including functional requirements, non-functional requirements, use cases, data models, and API definitions. This section serves as the authoritative source for understanding the project's intended behavior and guiding implementation efforts.

## Repository

The full specifications repository is available at:
https://github.com/a5c-ai/specs

Use this repository to review and contribute to specification changes via issues and pull requests.

## Key Topics

- **Requirements Overview**: Summarizes functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Use Cases & User Stories**: Defines key user workflows and scenarios.
- **Data Models**: Describes primary entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **API Specifications**: Details endpoints, request/response schemas, and error codes.
- **System Architecture**: Provides high-level diagrams and component descriptions.
- **Constraints & Assumptions**: Lists project constraints, dependencies, and assumptions.

## Best Practices

- Keep specifications up to date: submit changes via PRs in the specs repository.
- Write clear, consistent user stories: follow the templates provided in the specs repo.
- Define measurable acceptance criteria: ensure requirements can be validated.
- Reference spec items in code comments and tests: include spec IDs for traceability.

## Examples

### Referencing an API spec in code

```python
# See Spec: API-USER-001 in https://github.com/a5c-ai/specs/blob/main/api/user.md
```

## Integration Points

- **CI Pipelines**: automate validation of code against specs.
- **Issue Tracking**: tag issues with `spec:` prefix to link work to specs.
- **Documentation**: cross-link APIs and data models back to this section.
