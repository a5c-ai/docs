# Architecture

This section provides an overview of the a5c system architecture, outlines its main components, and describes how they interact. Fill in the placeholders below with actual diagrams and detailed component descriptions.

## System Overview

Include a high-level system architecture diagram illustrating major components and their relationships:

```rest
.. figure:: /images/architecture/system_overview.png
   :alt: System architecture overview
   :align: center

   High-level architecture overview diagram.
```

Provide a brief summary of the overall architecture here.

## Components

Describe each core component of the system. Replace placeholders with actual descriptions and diagrams.

### Web Application

```rest
.. figure:: /images/architecture/web_app.png
   :alt: Web Application component
   :align: center

   Web Application component diagram.
```

**Description:** Provide details about the web application (UI, framework, responsibilities).

### API Gateway

```rest
.. figure:: /images/architecture/api_gateway.png
   :alt: API Gateway component
   :align: center

   API Gateway component diagram.
```

**Description:** Describe the API Gateway's role in routing and request handling.

### Agent Orchestration Engine

```rest
.. figure:: /images/architecture/orchestration_engine.png
   :alt: Agent Orchestration Engine component
   :align: center

   Agent Orchestration Engine component diagram.
```

**Description:** Explain how the orchestration engine manages AI agents and workflows.

### Data Storage

```rest
.. figure:: /images/architecture/data_storage.png
   :alt: Data Storage component
   :align: center

   Data storage component diagram.
```

**Description:** Outline the databases or storage services used for persisting state and metadata.

## Component Interactions

Use sequence or flow diagrams to illustrate key interactions between components:

```rest
.. figure:: /images/architecture/component_interactions.png
   :alt: Component interaction flow
   :align: center

   Sequence diagram showing interactions between components.
```

List and describe the primary interaction flows:

- **User Request Flow:** Describe how a user request travels from the Web Application through the API Gateway to the Orchestration Engine and back.
- **Agent Workflow Flow:** Explain how the Orchestration Engine schedules and executes AI agents and returns results.

*Additional interaction scenarios can be added here.*
