| `execution_timeout` | Maximum execution time per agent | `30` (minutes) |
| `tool_permissions` | Allowed tools and capabilities | Agent-dependent |

## 4. MCP Servers

MCP (Memory, Communication, Persistence) Servers provide shared state and context across agent activations.

### Responsibilities

- Maintain persistent agent memory
- Enable inter-agent communication
- Store and retrieve documents
- Manage workflow state
- Provide knowledge bases and context

### Key Features

#### Memory Management

- Persistent key-value storage
- Vector embeddings for semantic retrieval
- Context windowing and prioritization
- Memory compression and summarization

#### Communication Facilitation

- Asynchronous message passing
- Structured communication protocols
- Event broadcasting
- Publish/subscribe patterns

#### Document Storage

- File versioning and history
- Content indexing
- Metadata management
- Access control

### MCP Server Types

#### Filesystem MCP

- Local file-based storage
- Document versioning through git
- Simple key-value persistence
- Best for single-repository scenarios

#### GitHub MCP

- Uses GitHub as storage backend
- Issues and discussions for communication
- Repository content for document storage
- Wiki for knowledge base management

#### Dedicated MCP

- Standalone server with database
- Vector database for semantic search
- Message queue for communication
- Object storage for documents
- Best for multi-repository scenarios

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `server_type` | MCP server implementation | `github` |
| `retention_policy` | Data retention duration | `30` (days) |
| `index_strategy` | Indexing approach for retrieval | `hybrid` |
| `backup_frequency` | Backup schedule | `daily` |

## 5. Agent Registry

The Agent Registry manages agent definitions, configurations, and discovery.

### Responsibilities

- Store agent definitions and metadata
- Handle agent versioning
- Manage agent inheritance
- Facilitate agent discovery
- Validate agent configurations

### Key Features

#### Agent Definition Management

- YAML and Markdown parsing
- Validation of agent configurations
- Version control integration

## Agent Tools

Agents have access to various tools to interact with the environment and perform tasks.

### Core Tools

#### GitHub Tools

### Tool Integration Architecture

Tools follow a consistent integration pattern:

1. **Tool Definition**: Interface and capability specification
2. **Permission Model**: Access control requirements
3. **Input Validation**: Parameter validation and sanitization
4. **Execution Logic**: Core functionality implementation
5. **Output Formatting**: Consistent result structure
6. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses
