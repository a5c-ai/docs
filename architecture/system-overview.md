# System Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the A5C (agentic) system architecture.

## Architectural Philosophy

A5C follows a distributed agent-based architecture designed for:

1. **Modularity**: Independent components with specific responsibilities
2. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new agents and capabilities
3. **GitHub-centric**: Native integration with GitHub workflows
4. **Asynchronous processing**: Event-driven approach to task handling
5. **Collaborative intelligence**: Multiple specialized agents working together

## Core System Components

The A5C system consists of these primary components:

### 1. GitHub Action Runner

- Entry point for GitHub-triggered events
- Processes webhooks and event payloads
- Maintains authentication context with GitHub
- Dispatches events to the Agent Dispatcher

### 2. Agent Dispatcher

- Routes events to appropriate agents based on trigger criteria
- Manages agent activation and scheduling
- Maintains agent registry and configuration
- Handles agent discovery and collaboration

### 3. Agent Runtime

- Executes agent operations in isolated environments
- Provides access to tools and APIs
- Maintains security boundaries between agents
- Handles agent lifecycle management

### 4. MCP (Memory, Communication, Persistence) Servers

- Provides shared state and memory across agent activations
- Enables inter-agent communication
- Persists agent context and knowledge
- Manages document storage and retrieval

### 5. Agent Registry

- Stores agent definitions and configurations
- Manages agent versioning and inheritance
- Handles agent discovery mechanisms
- Validates agent security and permissions

## System Layers

A5C is organized into several architectural layers:

### 1. Integration Layer

The outermost layer that interfaces with GitHub and other external systems:
- GitHub Action integration
- Webhook processing
- Authentication and security
- Event normalization

### 2. Orchestration Layer

Manages the coordination of agents and workflows:
- Agent dispatch and routing
- Trigger evaluation
- Agent discovery
- Workflow management

### 3. Execution Layer

Handles the actual running of agent tasks:
- Agent runtime environments
- Tool access and security
- Resource allocation
- Context management

### 4. Persistence Layer

Manages data storage and state:
- MCP servers
- Knowledge bases
- Document storage
- Configuration persistence

## Deployment Model

A5C can be deployed in several configurations:

### GitHub Action Based (Standard)

- Runs entirely through GitHub Actions
- Agents execute within GitHub Action runners
- Minimal self-hosted components required
- Uses GitHub for storage and persistence

### Hybrid Deployment

- GitHub Action for integration
- Self-hosted agent runtime for enhanced capabilities
- Self-hosted MCP servers
- Greater control and customization

### Fully Self-Hosted

- Complete control over all components
- Enhanced security and compliance options
- Private network deployment
- Custom integrations with internal systems

## Security Architecture

A5C implements security at multiple levels:

### 1. Authentication

- GitHub-based authentication
- JWT token validation
- OAuth integration for third-party services

### 2. Authorization

- Agent-level permission scopes
- Repository-based access controls
- Least privilege principles

### 3. Isolation

- Agent runtime sandboxing
- Tool access restrictions
- Environment isolation

### 4. Audit and Monitoring

- Comprehensive action logging
- Security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection
