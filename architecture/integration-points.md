# Integration Points

This document provides comprehensive details about the integration points available in the a5c system, explaining how a5c connects with GitHub and other external systems.

## GitHub Integration

GitHub serves as the primary integration platform for a5c, providing both event triggers and interaction points.

### GitHub Events

a5c integrates with GitHub's webhook event system to trigger agent activations:

| Event Type | Description | Available Triggers |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `push` | Code pushed to repository | Branch, file path patterns |
| `pull_request` | PR opened, updated, closed | Action type, labels, branch patterns |
| `issues` | Issue opened, updated, closed | Action type, labels, assignees |
| `issue_comment` | Comment on issue or PR | Mention patterns, content keywords |
| `pull_request_review` | Review submitted on PR | Review type, reviewer, file patterns |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Comment on specific PR lines | Mention patterns, content keywords |
| `workflow_run` | GitHub Action workflow completed | Workflow name, conclusion |
| `schedule` | Time-based event | Cron expression |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual trigger | Input parameters |
| `repository_dispatch` | External API trigger | Event type, client payload |

### GitHub API

a5c provides agents with access to GitHub's API for various operations:

## Integration Architecture

a5c implements a layered integration architecture to provide consistent and secure connections to external systems.

### Integration Adapters

a5c uses adapters to standardize integration with different systems:

```
External System → Integration Adapter → Normalized Events → a5c Core System
```

Each adapter implements:
- Authentication handling
- Request/response formatting
- Event normalization
- Error handling and retry logic

### Integration Connector Framework

The connector framework provides a consistent approach for all integrations:

1. **Connection Management**
   - Establish and maintain connections
   - Handle connection pooling
   - Implement connection retry logic
   - Monitor connection health

2. **Authentication**
   - Manage credentials securely
   - Handle token refresh and rotation
   - Support multiple auth methods
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Convert between system formats
   - Validate and sanitize data
   - Handle format versioning
   - Implement schema mapping

4. **Event Routing**
   - Direct events to appropriate handlers
   - Filter relevant events
   - Prioritize event processing
   - Handle out-of-order events

## Custom Integration Development

a5c provides several approaches for developing custom integrations:

### Integration Plugin System

Create custom integrations using the plugin system:

```
├── integration/
│   ├── my_integration/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── adapter.py      # Integration adapter implementation
│   │   ├── schema.py       # Data schemas
│   │   ├── api.py          # API client
│   │   └── config.yml      # Configuration
```

### Webhook Integration

For simpler integrations, use the webhook integration capability:

1. Configure an incoming webhook in a5c
2. Send HTTP requests to the webhook endpoint
3. Map payload fields to a5c event fields
4. Define trigger conditions for agents

### Command Line Integration

For local tooling, use the CLI integration:

1. Install the a5c CLI
2. Configure authentication
3. Use CLI commands to trigger agents and workflows
4. Pipe data between local tools and a5c

## Integration Authentication and Security

a5c implements several security measures for integrations:

### Authentication Methods

- **API Keys**: Simple key-based authentication
- **OAuth 2.0**: Standard OAuth flow for web services
- **JWT**: Signed tokens for secure authentication
- **OIDC**: OpenID Connect for enterprise SSO
- **Certificate-based**: For high-security environments

### Security Controls

- **Permission Scopes**: Fine-grained access control
- **IP Restrictions**: Limit access by source IP
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS
- **Audit Logging**: Track all integration activities
- **Secret Rotation**: Automatic credential rotation

## Integration Configuration

Integrations are configured in the `.a5c/config.yml` file:

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    type: github_app
    app_id: "12345"
    private_key: "${GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY}"
    webhook_secret: "${GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET}"
    
  slack:
    type: oauth2
    client_id: "${SLACK_CLIENT_ID}"
    client_secret: "${SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET}"
    scopes: ["chat:write", "channels:read"]
    
  jira:
    type: api_key
    url: "https://mycompany.atlassian.net"
    username: "integration@mycompany.com"
    api_key: "${JIRA_API_KEY}"
```

## Integration Development Best Practices

When developing custom integrations:

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Add retry logic for transient failures
   - Fail gracefully with fallback options

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Batch operations when possible
   - Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations

3. **Security**
   - Store credentials securely
   - Implement least-privilege access
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Use TLS for all communications

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Log all integration activities
   - Monitor performance and errors
   - Implement alerting for critical failures
   - Provide diagnostic information
