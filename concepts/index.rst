Agents
------

Agents are the core building blocks of A5C. Each agent is a specialized AI assistant with specific capabilities and responsibilities.

Learn more about agents in the :doc:`agents` page.

Triggers
--------

Triggers determine when and how agents are activated. A5C supports multiple trigger mechanisms, including events, mentions, schedules, labels, branches, and file patterns.

Learn more about triggers in the :doc:`triggers` page.

Configuration
------------

A5C uses a flexible, hierarchical configuration system that allows for both global and agent-specific settings.

Learn more about configuration in the :doc:`configuration` page.

MCP (Model Context Protocol)
------------------------

MCP enables agents to interact with external services and tools. A5C includes built-in MCP servers for common operations.

Learn more about MCP in the :doc:`mcp` page.

Agent Discovery
-------------

Agent discovery allows agents to find and collaborate with other agents in the system.

Learn more about agent discovery in the :doc:`agent-discovery` page.

CLI Integration
-------------

A5C supports multiple CLI tools for agent execution, including Claude, Aider, and Cursor.

Learn more about CLI integration in the :doc:`cli-integration` page.
